* plugins for Gem

this is a collection of plugins, that allow Gem to accomplish input and output
of media files in a platform-specific way.

** Developer notes

*** verbosity-levels
when reporting errors, keep in mind that oftentimes the current plugin is only
one in a long chain.
e.g. when a film-plugin fails to open a movie file, the next plugin in the
chain might succeed. therefore, to keep noise for the end user low, the
reporting verbosity should be kept low; usually below post() level.
errors that happen once a plugin has been selected, may be more load.
reporting from (potentially) threaded callbacks, should avoid using Pd's
post(),... functions and instead just printf() to the stderr.

| loglevel   | maximum visible verbosity      |
|------------+--------------------------------|
| LOG:fatal  | verbose(..-3)                  |
| LOG:error  | pd_error, error, verbose(..-2) |
| LOG:normal | post, verbose(..-1)            |
| LOG:debug  | verbose(..0)                   |
| LOG:all    | verbose(..verbosity)           |

***** namespace
it would be nice if all plugins supported a common prefix, so people can know where the error comes from,
e.g. "[GEM:filmAVI]"

***** idea
 - fatal errors that /must/ effect the user (because the current plugin is selected and there cannot be an alternative) ~error()~
 - non-fatal errors effecting the user: ~verbose(0)~ (warning)
 - errors that /might/ effect the user must be ~verbose(0)~
 - debugging output should be done with ~verbose(1)~

The following is an attempt to define the apropriate logging levels

| ~setProperties~  | ~verbose(0)~, ~error()~ for opened devices |
| ~getProperties~  | ~verbose(0)~, ~error()~ for opened devices |
| ~open~           | ~verbose(0)~                               |
| ~close~          | ~error()~                                  |
| ~changeImage~    | ~error()~                                  |
| ~getFrame~       | ~error()~, ~printf()~ if threaded          |
