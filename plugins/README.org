* plugins for Gem

this is a collection of plugins, that allow Gem to accomplish input and output
of media files in a platform-specific way.

** Developer notes

*** verbosity-levels
when reporting errors, keep in mind that oftentimes the current plugin is only
one in a long chain.
e.g. when a film-plugin fails to open a movie file, the next plugin in the
chain might succeed. therefore, to keep noise for the end user low, the
reporting verbosity should be kept low; usually below post() level.
errors that happen once a plugin has been selected, may be more load.
reporting from (potentially) threaded callbacks, should avoid using Pd's
post(),... functions and instead just printf() to the stderr.

- LOG:fatal  : verbose(..-3)
- LOG:error  : pd_error, error, verbose(..-2)
- LOG:normal : post, verbose(..-1)
- LOG:debug  : verbose(..0)
- LOG:all    : verbose(..verbosity)

idea:
 -errors that must effect the user (because the current plugin is selected and there cannot be an alternative): error()

The following is an attempt to define the apropriate logging levels

| -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| CTOR           | verbose(0)                             |
| DTOR           | verbose(0)                             |
| isThreadable   | verbose(0)                             |
| enumProperties | verbose(0), error() for opened devices |
| setProperties  | verbose(0), error() for opened devices |
| getProperties  | verbose(0), error() for opened devices |
| open           | verbose(0)                             |
| close          | error(0)                               |
| changeImage    | error(0)                               |
| getFrame       | error(0), printf() if threaded         |
