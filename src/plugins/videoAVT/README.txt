backend for pix_video using Prosilica's "AVT GiGE SDK"

"AVT GiGE SDK" is a commercial library that can do image-acquisition from
GiGE-cameras.
"AVT" stands for "Allied Vision Technologies" and is the consortium defining the
GiGE-standard.

You have to get Prosilica's SDK from either
 - http://prosilica.com
 - http://www.alliedvisiontec.com/us/products/software.html
 - or whereever they have moved it now
in order to use it with Gem.

At the time of writing, the SDK runs on W32, linux, OSX and QNX
