videoAVT
========

backend for pix_video using Prosilica's "AVT GiGE SDK"

"AVT GiGE SDK" is a commercial library that can do image-acquisition from
GiGE-cameras.
You have to get their SDK from either
 - http://www.alliedvisiontec.com/us/products/software.html
 - http://prosilica.com
 - or whereever they have moded it now
in order to use it with Gem.

At the time of writing, the SDK runs on W32, linux, OSX and QNX
