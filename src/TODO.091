General Rendering Issues
: alpha in gemwindow?
: stencil buffer

Missing help-patches
: glsl_*
: arb-shaders
: pix_record
: pix_share_{read,write}


Untested objects
: gemframebuffer
: gempbuffer
: pix_share_{read,write}


Object specific bugs
: [pix_write] upside down when using jpg
: [pix_image] sometimes crashes when loading non-existant image (or image which is neither jpeg nor tiff)
: [separator] memleak


OS specific bugs
linux:
: sometimes window freezes on "destroy"
: when the window is closed from "outside", destroying it (and sometimes even rendering to it) will destroy the window
: pix_record still not compiling



osx:
: autoconf buildsystem non-functional
: remove checks for valid openGL-context
: SequenceGrabber long-term stability (keeps logging you out)
