:- will unlikely be resolved for gem-0.91
+ resolved
- will NOT be resolved for gem-0.91


General Rendering Issues
: alpha in gemwindow?
: stencil buffer

Missing help-patches
+ glsl_* (DONE)
+ arb-shaders (DONE)
+ pix_record
+ pix_share_{read,write} (DONE)
:+ gemframebuffer

Untested objects
: gemframebuffer
+ pix_share_{read,write} (DONE, works now on linux; has to be tested on OSX again)


Object specific bugs
+ [pix_write] upside down when using jpg (WORKSFORME - confirmed by cyrille henry) 
+ [pix_image] sometimes crashes when loading non-existant image (or image which is neither jpeg nor tiff) (WORKSFORME - confirmed by cyrille henry) 
: [separator] memleak


OS specific bugs
linux:
:- sometimes window freezes on "destroy"
+ when the window is closed from "outside", destroying it (and sometimes even rendering to it) will destroy the window (hopefully FIXED)
+ pix_record still not compiling with old libquicktime (FIXED)



osx:
: autoconf buildsystem non-functional
: remove checks for valid openGL-context
: SequenceGrabber long-term stability (keeps logging you out)
