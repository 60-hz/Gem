General:
 osx: carbon/QuickTime not supported anymore since 10.6


Output:
	multiple output
	"external" windows
   alpha in gemwindow?

 linux: sometimes window freezes on "destroy"; (JMZ: i experience this sometimes on improper shutdown, but after some (up to 30) seconds, the window finally gets destroyed and pd exits fine; if this is the same as the reported bug, than it is rather an inconvenience than a real bug; does this also happens with Output/ objects or only with the old code?)
 linux: resizing the window yields weird results
 osx: [gemcocoawindow] compatible with [gemmacwindow]?


Controls:
	selectables

Geos:
	vertex stuff

Manips:

Nongeos: 
	add other light-types
	check for the maximum number of lights during runtime

Pixes:
	MMX, SSE2
		pix_blur pix_tIIR pix_motionblur: these call explicitely the altivec-functions if compiled with alitvec, rather than relying on the SIMD-dispatcher; remove explicit calls!
	windows movie loader (have a look at guliverkli?; use gmerlin?)

	upsidedown: pix_rectangle does not respect the upside-down flag and thus sometimes the rectangle appears in the upper-left corner and sometimes in the lower-left corner
	generally all images on all platforms should have the same (upsidedown!) orientation
  see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/443086/opengl-topdown-bottomup-textures


	pix_rtx: flickering on OSX/ppc in mode#0; 
		how to prevent execessive memory usage?

	pix_threshold: intial arguments

	pix_crop: arguments/inlets differ!

  pix_freeframe not supported on x86_64 architectures (newer versions of FF support x86_64; check whether this is compatible)

	videopipes:
		W32:AVIsynth/frameserver (http://www.debugmode.com/frameserver/)
		W32:VirtualCamera
		OSX:Syphon (http://syphon.v002.info/)

 osx: pix_movie flickers (check whether this is still true)
 w32: [pix_share_*] does not exist since the shared-memory concept has not made it to redmond yet
 w32: crashes when texturing movies (related to GLEW?)



dreaming:
 Pd-callbacks:
  remove the entire callback-stuff for Pd-messages from the obj_realSetup()
  instead this should be handled centrally in CPPExtern
	- each member function called <name>Mess() provides a method for "<name>"
	- dispatching can be done by Pd or Gem (the latter being easier)
  info/ideas
    - http://www.codeproject.com/KB/winsdk/callback_adapter.aspx
    - Qt slot concept (http://sigslot.sourceforge.net/)
    - reflection/inspection
    - function-name demangling: http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc/proguide/ref/rkcxxflt.htm

 wrap the entire Pd thing into C++:
	GemOutlet()->send(int val);

BUGS:
 look into flext conflict (i guess it's related to "new/delete")

 single-object externals will run the setup-function twice; this gives nasty warnings in Pd-0.42
