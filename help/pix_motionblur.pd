#X text 25 13 pix_motionblur this object applies a very simple and
fast motion blur to an image stream. the method used involves blending
the current image with a 'history' image and saving the result back
to the 'history'. the blending is the same as pix_mix output = (stream
* gain) + (history * 1 - gain) applying a higher blur factor will mix
in more of the history image and thus more of the history will be saved
resulting in heavier blurring.;
