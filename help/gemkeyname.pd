#X text 51 318 [gemkeyname] sends out keyboard events which occur in
the GEM window. Such event will give a symbolic description of the
button. The "state"-outlet will be 1 for KEY_DOWN and 0 for KEY_UP.
;
#X text 52 383 It is not guaranteed \, that Windows and Linux versions
will give the same description for the same key pressed !!! Also \,
there is no guarantee \, that the pd-object [keyname] will return the
same symbols as [gemkeyname];
#X text 49 456 Furthermore \, i would like to make this object really
cross-platform one day. Thus the KeyName might change on one system
or another in future times.;
